        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>"Should I Take?" was developed based on documentation available online about drugs and their interactions with
           other drugs, conditions and operations. None of the members of the Foxtrot team have medical expertise and the
           advice is computed by a machine trained to identify key information. If unsure, please follow the links
           provided by the app or visit your doctor.</p>
